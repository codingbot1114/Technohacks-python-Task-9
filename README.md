Developing a Random Password Generator
A random password generator is a tool or program designed to create strong and secure passwords that are difficult for others to guess or crack. These passwords typically include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The purpose of using a random password generator is to enhance the security of your accounts by generating passwords that are complex and less susceptible to brute-force attacks.
